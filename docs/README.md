## Creational
- [Constructor Design Pattern](creational/constructor-design-pattern.md)
- [Constructor Prototype Design Pattern](creational/constructor-prototype-design-pattern.md)
- [Module Design Pattern](creational/module-design-pattern.md)
- Factory Design Pattern
- Singleton Design Pattern

## Structural
- Decorator Design Pattern
- Facade Design Pattern
- FlyWeight Design Pattern

## Behavioral
- Command Design Pattern
- Mediator Design Pattern
- Observer Design Pattern
